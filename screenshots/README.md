### World Wide View
The geonotebook is designed to provide a dynamic interactive map for visualization and analysis of geospatial data in a familiar jupyter notebook format. On the left is a standard jupyter notebook. On the right a is a [GeoJS](http://opengeoscience.github.io/geojs/examples/index.html) map. Geonotebook connects these two allowing the python cells to visualize data on the map and regions of this data to be selected on the map for further analysis.

### NDVI layer 
Here we've added an NDVI layer from a Geotiff to the notebook for analysis.

### Some RGB layers with analysis
Here we've added RGB layers from a geotiff. On the right we've zoomed way in on an area north of Moses Lake WA. We've selected a region from an agricultural area and on the left we're performing a rudimentary segmenting analysis to determine the number of fields.
